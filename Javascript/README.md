# UFO sightings 
A simple creation to use javascript to dynamically update table data to filter ufo sighting data.

## The Problem
With the nature of ufo sighting reporting there ends up being too many data points to filter and observe. 

## The Solution
Using javascript I was able to identify elements on the html page to update the data displayed based upon desired filters.

## Moving Forward
Through this project I was able to better understand how powerful using multiple languages and technologies together can be. I would love to invest more time in cleaning up the css, adding dropdowns that autopopulate with cities and countries in the data, and include a data range filter.
