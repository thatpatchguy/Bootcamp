# A project to tackle portraying a large json dataset on a responsive page based upon user input.
## Essentially each time the user selects a new patient it will update 4 things on the page using d3
1. The demographic data we have, showing the public data for each patient.
2. The bar graph showing the top 10 (or less if less are present) OTU levels.
3. A gauge showing the amount of times the patient washes their belly button each week
4. A bubble scatter plot showing the levels of all otu's present with size and height both dependent on the level. Colors match the bar graph for ease of understanding
