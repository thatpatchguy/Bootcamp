# D3 Responsive Visualization Project

Through this project the goal was to illustrate our ability to create a scatter plot of multiple elements in an understandable way.

Some ways I attempted to make my scatter plot more informative:
1. State abbreviations inside of the circles
2. Tooltips when the mouse hovers a circle
3. Multiple axis options on both x and y axes
4. Random changing of color to allow for user to create differentiation in circle color
