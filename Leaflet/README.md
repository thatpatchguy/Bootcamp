# Earthquake visualization project

For this project I combined knowledge about API's, Leaftlet, and D3 to portray the data from the last 10 days of earthquake activity.

### Notes

- Circle radius is based upon the magnitude of the earthquake
- Color also based on a 6 step scale based upon magnitude
- Tectonic plates layer shows lines of tectonic plate boundaries

### Sources
- Earthquakes: https://earthquake.usgs.gov
- Tectonic Plates: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fraxen/tectonicplates/master/GeoJSON/PB2002_boundaries.json
