# SQL Assignment

For this assignment we used PGadmin and ERD creation methods to query a database of employees for a company. It was fascinating to learn about database relations and how to organize larger amounts of data.

There were essentially 3 parts to this assignment:

### 1. ERD creation
I analyzed several csv's to determine how I was going to connect them and created a diagram to visualize it better for myself. This was very useful for me to refer to later.

### 2. Table creation
Here I used queries to create all the different tables in my PGadmin database.

### 3. Querying results
From the tables that I created using SQL and uploading the CSV's I queried the results to answer the following questions.

1. List the following details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary.


2. List first name, last name, and hire date for employees who were hired in 1986.


3. List the manager of each department with the following information: department number, department name, the manager's employee number, last name, first name.


4. List the department of each employee with the following information: employee number, last name, first name, and department name.


5. List first name, last name, and sex for employees whose first name is "Hercules" and last names begin with "B."


6. List all employees in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.


7. List all employees in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.


8. In descending order, list the frequency count of employee last names, i.e., how many employees share each last name.
